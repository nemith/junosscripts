# Collection of Junos Automation Scripts by Brandon Bennett

This repository is a list of commit, op, and event scripts for Junos that I have created over the years to help automate junos and provide a sample of what Junos automation can do.

## Scripts 
 * show-zone-for-ip

   This script is useful on SRX platforms where you need to idenify the zone for a paticular IP address using the routing table and matching that up with interfaces.  Supports virtual routers

## Contributing
I am always looking for fixes, optimization, clean-up of these scripts.  Additions are also welcome.  Pull Requests are welcome!
