# Collection of Junos Automation Scripts by Brandon Bennett

This repository is a list of commit, op, and event scripts for Junos that I have created over the years to help automate junos and provide a sample of what Junos automation can do.

## Scripts 

### Commit scripts
 * dhcp-reserve-range

    Reserve a range to be used for static-bindings by created fake static bindings to "reserve" the range

### Op scripts
 * show-zone-for-ip

   This script is useful on SRX platforms where you need to idenify the zone for a paticular IP address using the routing table and matching that up with interfaces.  Supports virtual routers



## Contributing
I am always looking for fixes, optimization, clean-up of these scripts.  Additions are also welcome.  Pull Requests are welcome!
